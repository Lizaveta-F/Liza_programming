                        <p>My name is Liza and I love travelling!!!</p>
                        <p>One year ago I relocated to Krakow and it was a love at a first glance!</p>
                        <p>For 25 years I had been living in Belarus, finished my high education there, btw I graduated from the Belarusian State University with honors and got a degree in Management. </p>
                        <p>At the beginning of 2022 I started to learn and dive deeper in the profession of developer, I've chosen Python as a script language. </p>
                        <p>Since then I've been trying hard to grasp as much information as I can in this field, taking up different kind of courses, self-educating and of course practicing my skills! =) And this project actually is my pet-one.</p>
                        <p>In my free time I am fond of taking pictures of nature and peopleðŸ–¼, playing the pianoðŸŽ¹, skatingâ›¸, sewingðŸª€ and singing ðŸŽ¤.</p>
